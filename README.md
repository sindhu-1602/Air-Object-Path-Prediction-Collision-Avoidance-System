# Air Object Path Prediction & Collision Avoidance System✈️ 

> A DRDO internship project developed at the Propulsion & Ground Armament Division (PGAD), DRDL Hyderabad, focusing on real-time aircraft trajectory prediction, scientific visualization, and collision avoidance using GUI systems and ML models.

---
## Overview

This system is designed to plot the trajectory of air objects (e.g., missiles, aircraft) and predict possible collision paths. Built using Qt (C++), PostgreSQL, MATLAB, and Python ML tools, the project simulates a real-time GUI application for defense-grade path prediction.
